WALTA

Install notes:

dependencies:
node
npm

run npm install

cocoapod for iOS build

run sudo gem install cocoapods

also since appium is looking for the WebDriverAgent in the wrong place you need to:

cd node_modules/appium/node_modules
ln -s ../../appium-webdriveragent appium-webdriveragent

Some thing to do with how NPM packaging works seem to put the modules in the root directory rather than in the appium/node_modules folder as the appium code expects. 
FIXME: figure out what is supposed to happen and complain about it??

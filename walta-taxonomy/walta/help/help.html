<h2>Mayfly Muster</h2>
<p>Use this option to log a sighting of mayfly nymphs. You can use the 
keys and speedbug to figure out what type of mayfly it is.</p>

<h2>QUICK Waterbug Survey </h2>
<p>Use this option to do a quick assessment of your site. Waterbug IDs are 
completed to order level, which takes less time than completing a 
detailed survey. Order level differences are easy to see, they 
distinguish the mayflies (Order: Ephemeroptera), from the dragonflies 
(Order: Odonata) and the beetles (order: Coleoptera).</p>

<h2>DETAILED Waterbug Survey </h2>
<p>Use this survey to complete a detailed assessment of your site. You 
will need a hand lens to see some of the characters you are asked about 
in the keys. Some of the identifications made with this method are at 
species level, some are at order, it all depends on what you can 
reliably see of live critters with a magnifying glass.</p>

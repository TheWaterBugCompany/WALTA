      <description>
        Crustaceans can vary in size quite a lot. Large freshwater crayfish start life smaller
        than 5mm, so be aware that the sizes in this section all refer to maximum length.

        Many of the larger crustaceans can be recognised by their distinctive shapes and often we
        are familiar with them because their less fortunate relatives feature on restaurant menus.

        Yabbies, shrimp and shield shrimp are simpler to recognise from pictures than descriptions
        so the first part of the following key introduces the larger, commoner crustaceans you are
        likely to find.

            Nothing, very distinctive. We have left crayfish and Yabbies grouped together
            because they mostly turn up as juveniles in samples and are difficult to separate when young.

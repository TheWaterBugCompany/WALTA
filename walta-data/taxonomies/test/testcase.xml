			<description>
				Crustaceans can vary in size quite a lot.  Large freshwater crayfish start life smaller 
				than 5mm, so be aware that the sizes in this section all refer to maximum length. 
				
				Many of the larger crustaceans can be recognised by their distinctive shapes and often we 
				are familiar with them because their less fortunate relatives feature on restaurant menus. 
				
				Yabbies, shrimp and shield shrimp are simpler to recognise from pictures than descriptions
				so the first part of the following key introduces the larger, commoner crustaceans you are 
				likely to find.

						Nothing, very distinctive.  We have left crayfish and Yabbies grouped together
